# Curve

Individuals will approach professional development along an adoption curve. This behavior is indicative of their general approach to change whether a new tool, service, or workflow.

- innovator
- early
- majority
- late
- laggard

## Innovator (innovator)

The innovator is somebody who is not only an early adopter but will innovate by extending in new ways, mixing a solution with other technology in novel ways, etc.

## Early Adopter (early)

An early adopter is a trend setter who is motivated by recognition. They want to achieve technical excellence and will experiment with new tools, new techniques, and new services to become better at their role. They are more likely to try something new even if it does not have a rational decision-making benefit for their organization because they are motivated by learning. This is the persona that will develop a new greenfield project in a new framework because they wanted to try it out.

These folks are often who you will engage wiht at:
- hackathon
- blog posts
- event talks

For an early adopter who is more social, their extraverted side will motivate them to learn through the exchange of ideas:

- meetups
- social media, chat forums
- panels & webinars

This persona is more likely to be an influential member of their team.

## Majority (majority)

The majority user is likely a toolsmith who is motivated by the pursuit of learning and investing in themselves. They want to be ready with the appropriate tools for a future task which they want to complete efficiently.

Good ways to reach this persona include:

- conceptual guides
- talks at events
- blog posts

For the majority adopter, they need a bit more convincing of the pros/cons and explanations for the tradeoffs and why their time is best invested on this content over alternatives.

## Latecomer (late)

The latecomer wants to adopt new tools, but is more of a 9 to 5 persona who does not often come into contact with industry trends until they are well established.


## Laggard (laggard)

The laggard persona will do the bare minimum when it comes to adoption. Learning must be mandatory before they would seek it out. They are compliant (barely) and will follow the direction of authority but will not often seek to develop new skills.

To their defense, a laggard may only be a laggard within one dimension of their role. For instance, a laggard for CI/CD tools may in fact be an innovator for API design.

The laggard will typically be pretty proficient with their current skills and tools but have chosen other priorities. Their motivation is derived from driving revenue for the organization and will act to keep their job or would take mandatory steps to seek a better role.

It can be difficult to reach this type of adopter. Some techniques include:

- corporate training
- workshops
- reference documentation

A laggard is not motivated purely by learning but by the shortest path to a solution. You can cut out the story-telling and narrative to a piece and focus on pragmatic advice.
