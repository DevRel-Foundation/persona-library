# Parent

The DEVREL-PS supports a hierarchy of personas. This allows for the definition of a persona that inherits all the true values of its parent and extends it.

There is a convention to have `x-` as a prefix for any attributes that can extend the parent. Reuse of the same attribute will use the definition from the child rather than the parent, effectively overwriting traits and attributes.
