# Tools

The tools used by a certain role can have importance in identifying integration opportunities and the larger context of any jobs to be done for the
responsibilities of the persona.

The [DevRel Foundation Tools Catalog](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/Tools-Catalog) can be used to identify the broader categories of tools.  The tools are prefixed with `drf-` to indicate this is a category key.
