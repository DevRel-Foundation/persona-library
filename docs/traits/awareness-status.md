# Status

The relationship status indicates how aware the persona is with the organization product or services. This often is used to further segment personas by where they are in the buyer journey rather than being discrete personas otherwise.

- pro
- user
- partner
- lead
- unaware
- ex

Unaware is the default because we are trying to reach the persona to convince them of the value of our products or services and turn them into a lead.

## Pro Customer (pro)

A pro-user who is aware of most of the features and capabilities of your offerings and are an expert user. They stay abreast of new releases.

- newsletter
- roadmap presentations

## General Customer (user)

A general customer is a user, but may only use one product or service that is offerred. They may not be aware of other solutions, may not understand how to make use of them, or just be early in their adoption.

The relationship is established and the organizations have a transactional as well as a commitment to one another.

## Partner

The partner relationship encompasses a wider range of business activities beyond a commercial transaction. Personas with this trait may be important for certain businesses to consider.

- independent service vendor
- systems integrator
- business development
- co-marketing

Sometimes you may seek out this type of persona as a business development activity.

## Lead

The relationship is not yet committed, but there is confidence the persona is a match.

This encompasses each of:
- marketing qualified
- sales qualified
- devrel qualified

## Unaware

There is a lack of awareness of the fit for your products or services for this persona. You are trying to reach them as thewith this persona.

## Ex

They have churned from using the product and services offerred for any of a number of reasons. They are aware but not actively using.

It take extra effort to win this persona back and if unhappy may be a detractor that influences others away.
