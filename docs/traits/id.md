# Identifier

The id helps identify the type of persona in a discrete mutually exclusive manner. You will not define two personas 
for your org with the same identifier. The identifier should work across organizational bounds to set expectations of
a persona based on the trait definitions.

## Label

A label is available to give a colloquial description for a persona. So for example, you might have an identifier like **mix-ai-trendsetter-I-infl** with the label _"Alex the Advocate"_.

## Narrative

A narrative is expected to be a long-form string that tells a story about the persona. The narrative is often defined by an individual organization as it relates to their products and services to be used by the persona of a given identifier.
