# Modality

The modality speaks to the style of resource that is most effective for the experience the persona seeks. You may also want to take into consideration the multimedia preferences as audio/video lends itself better to some modes better than text.

- problem
- learn
- understand
- info
- guide
- social

## Problem Oriented (problem)

Is seeking the shortest path to solving a specific problem leading to adoption.

- how-to guides
- debugging guides
- helpful error messages with URLs pointing to more docs or a forum/discussion page
- may not have patience for audio/video presentations

Somebody who fits this trait is impatient and does not want to watch a sizzle reel, has no interested in case studies, and may have an urgent time-bound requirement to fill so does not want to wait for a sales person.

## Learning Oriented (learn)

Is seeking to prepare themselves for anything and prefer a sequential order.

- tutorials
- simple toy apps
- api test applications
- good target for any audio/video presentations (podcasts, video tutorials)
- will read nurture emails
- infographics and visual reference are useful

## Understanding Oriented (understand)

More likely to experiment and tinker with a solution.

- sample demo apps they can take apart and modify one attribute at a time to see how it behaves
- conceptual guides
- behind the scenes / deconstruction
- academic explanations
- comparisons with other approaches
- good target for audio/video interview style formats

Will want to find a try for free / freemium offering that lets them evaluate before evaluating products that require guidance. The most skeptical modality because they want to see it for themselves.

## Information Oriented (info)

Not necessarily looking to understand but seeks specific answers to problems.

- may not have patience for audio/video presentations
- third-party comparison sites

The persona who is information oriented may lose patience at thought leadership and marketing details that lack substance. Words cannot be empty and must convey meaning. Succinct action-oriented statements work best for this type of modality.

## Guidance Oriented (guide)

Motivated to use the product rather than learn how to build with it. Adoption is aided by tools that guide them through in an experiential way rather than learning from reading the documentation. In-person events and social interaction is often part of being guided and given answers to their specific questions.

- guided tours in a product
- SDKs and CLIs that simplify usage
- third-party integratinos
- frequently asked questions
- workshops & training / webinars
- AI assistants
- boilerplate code (minimal sample app) to overcome inertia with something to build upon
- container with runnable environment

Guidance-oriented may be more likely to sign up for a demo with sales. 

## Socratic (social)

Learn by working with others and asking questions. The interaction with others in dialogue is how they develop a fully understanding of concepts and ideas.

- convey expertise or specialization in the area to win trust
- expectation is that the information is most up to date available, may distrust out of date documentation and resources that are not always maintained
- leave time or pause periodically for q&a
- host office hours

This may seem like extroverted behavior but its the learning style that is applicable. Somebody may join office hours if they are more outgoing, but somebody may still want the social interaction but prefers to see the agenda and benefits from the structure of delivery or learning from the questions others may ask.
