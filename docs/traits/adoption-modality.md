# Modality

The modality speaks to the style of resource that is most effective for the experience the persona seeks. You may also want to take into consideration the multimedia preferences as audio/video lends itself better to some modes better than text.

- problem
- learn
- understand
- info
- guide
- social

## Problem Oriented (problem)

Is seeking the shortest path to solving a specific problem leading to adoption.

- how-to guides
- debugging guides
- may not have patience for audio/video presentations

## Learning Oriented (learn)

Is seeking to prepare themselves for anything and prefer a sequential order.

- tutorials
- simple toy apps
- api test applications
- good target for any audio/video presentations (podcasts, video tutorials)
- will read nurture emails
- infographics and visual reference are useful

## Understanding Oriented (understand)

More likely to experiment and tinker with a solution.

- sample demo apps they can take apart and modify
- conceptual guides
- behind the scenes / deconstruction
- academic explanations
- comparisons with other approaches
- good target for audio/video interview style formats

Will want to find a try for free / freemium offering that lets them evaluate before evaluating products that require guidance. The most skeptical modality because they want to see it for themselves.

## Information Oriented (info)

Not necessarily looking to understand but seeks specific answers to problems.

- may not have patience for audio/video presentations
- third-party comparison sites

## Guidance Oriented (guide)

Motivated to use the product rather than learn how to build with it. Adoption is aided by tools that guide them through in an experiential way rather than learning from reading the documentation. In-person events and social interaction is often part of being guided and given answers to their specific questions.

- guided tours in a product
- SDKs and CLIs that simplify usage
- third-party integratinos
- frequently asked questions
- workshops & training / webinars
- AI assistants

Guidance-oriented may be more likely to sign up for a demo with sales.

## Socratic (social)

Learn by working with others and asking questions. The interaction with others in dialogue is how they develop a fully understanding of concepts and ideas.
