These traits help to flush out the range of considerations that the company itself may give context into understanding a particular persona and their behavior.

## GO TO MARKET (GTM)

### Business to Developers (b2d)

The company has products or services that are intended for use by a software developer. The developer has a strong degree of influence over recommending, integrating, and using the product for successful adoption.

This is sometimes referred to as *developer first*.

### Business to Business (b2b)

The company has products or services that are intended for use by somebody who is *not* a software developer. The developer may be involved with integrating and supporting the product but is not the end-user.

This is where system integrators (SI), consultants, and agencies could be considered.

This is sometimes referred to as *developer enabled*.

### Business to Consumers (b2c)

The company has products or services that are intended for use by somebody who is *not* a software developer but is an end-consumer. The product may be extensible or form a foundation for developers to build a business or channel through integrations.

It is not always very clear what role Developer Relations has in making this type of business successful.
