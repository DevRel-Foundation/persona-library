# Company Context

These traits help to flush out the range of considerations that the company itself may give context into understanding a particular persona and their behavior.

## GO TO MARKET (GTM)

The go to market strategy of the company can play an important role in understanding the context when working with a persona.

### Business to Developers (b2d)

The company has products or services that are intended for use by a software developer. The developer has a strong degree of influence over recommending, integrating, and using the product for successful adoption.

This is sometimes referred to as *developer first*.

### Business to Business (b2b)

The company has products or services that are intended for use by somebody who is *not* a software developer. The developer may be involved with integrating and supporting the product but is not the end-user.

This is where system integrators (SI), consultants, and agencies could be considered.

This is sometimes referred to as *developer enabled*.

### Business to Consumers (b2c)

The company has products or services that are intended for use by somebody who is *not* a software developer but is an end-consumer. The product may be extensible or form a foundation for developers to build a business or channel through integrations.

It is not always very clear what role Developer Relations has in making this type of business successful.

## MATURITY

The company may have a level of maturity in terms of standard operating procedures that influence its ability to adopt a new tool or technology.

Often, the size of the company is a further reflection of the organizational maturity. 

The size of a company is often taken into consideration in sales motions because of the revenue implications. This also has an implication on the responsibilities that might be given to a role within a company. This designation could be based on number of employees or amount of revenue.

The competitive environment and ecosystem in which the company operates can be a determining factor in how the business operates.

### Startup

A company that has not been around very long is quick to try new ideas, innovate, and explore. The resources available to make a purchasing decision may not be readily available but require fewer steps for approval.

A startup company is typically smaller and might include:
- fewer than 200 employees
- less than $10m in revenue

### Growth

A mid-size company might include:
- between 200 and 2000 employees
- revenue between $10m and $200m

They are in a stage of maturing and continued growth.

During the growth stage, the market need is confirmed and many companies are vying for market share in this emerging market.

### Enterprise

A company that has a long legacy within a business has very mature processes in place. This may indicate a long decision-making cycles and slower innovation timelines.

An enterprise company will often have:
- more than 2000 employees
- more than $200m in revenue

During consolidation companies are acquiring growth companies to secure their leadership position within the competitive environment.


## RELATIONSHIP

When thinking about personas, the relationship with the organization may also be a consideration as a dimension. You may need a persona for existing customers that is distinct from partner organizations or prospective customers.

### Customer

The relationship is established and the organizations have a transactional as well as a commitment to one another.

### Lead

The relationship is not yet committed, but there is confidence the persona is a match.

This encompasses each of:
- marketing qualified
- sales qualified
- devrel qualified

### Lurker

The relationship verges on being unknown. There may be a future transaction, but there are not enough signals to qualify the prospect as more than a persona that requires nurturing.

### Partner

The partner relationship encompasses a wider range of business activities beyond a commercial transaction. Personas with this trait may be important for certain businesses to consider.

- independent service vendor
- systems integrator
- business development
- co-marketing

## INDUSTRY

The industry in which a persona operates can have implications on their behaviors.

For each industry there may be specific interactions with other traits to better understand the persona.

- financial services
- technology
- hardware
- healthcare
- software tools
- communications
- transportation
