## Individual Contributor (ic)

An individual contributor produces value for the company directly through their labor. A typical individual contributor has internal influence but does not typically make purchasing decisions over a certain monetary value.

## Leadership (lead)

The lead may be a people leader or a functional lead in an area of specialization. The implication is that this persona has structural influence over other people or budgets and is a decision-maker when choosing products, tools, and services will be used by others. 

The lead may task an IC with research and advising to reach a decision.

## Executive (exec)

The executive indicates a higher placement within the organization chart. They have many of the same influence indicators as a lead but magnified to multiple groups.

### Influencer (infl)

Somebody who is an influencer transcends the boundaries of an organization. They have a role in how other organizations make decisions. The person may be an executive in function but could include roles like consultants, agencies, and ambassadors.
