## Individual Contributor (ic)

An individual contributor produces value for the company directly through their labor. A typical individual contributor has internal influence but does not typically make purchasing decisions over a certain monetary value.

## Leadership (lead)

The lead may be a people leader or a functional lead in an area of specialization. The implication is that this persona has structural influence over other people or budgets and is a decision-maker when choosing products, tools, and services will be used by others. 

The lead may task an IC with research and advising to reach a decision.

## Executive (exec)

The executive indicates a higher placement within the organization chart. They have many of the same influence indicators as a lead but magnified to multiple groups.

Very rare to have any hands-on contributions. Focus is on team growth and organizational behaviors including collaboration with other groups aligned with any business strategy outcomes they are responsible for driving.

If combined with startup trait, more likely to perform additional IC functions and in making technical decisions.

### Influencer (infl)

Somebody who is an influencer transcends the boundaries of an organization. They have a role in how other organizations make decisions. The person may be an executive in function but could include roles like consultants, agencies, and ambassadors.
