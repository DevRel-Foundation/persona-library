# Learning Style


## PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

### Minimalist

A persona that is a minimalist will typically only do the bare minimum or mandatory learning to achieve an outcome. They are compliant and follow the direction of authority but may not seek to develop new skills in certain circumstances. Somebody who is a minimalist on one type of problem may be a trendsetter (below) in a different domain.

Typically, the minimalist has proficiency with their current skills and tools. They may have other priorities so their motivation is typically derived from driving revenue for the organization, meaning they want to keep their job or be seeking to take mandatory steps to acquire a better role.

It can be difficult to reach somebody with this style of professional development.

### Toolsmith

A toolsmith is motivated by the pursuit of learning and investing in themselves. They want to be ready with the appropriate tools for a future task so that they can complete it efficiently.

- conceptual guides
- event talks
- blog posts

### Trendsetter

A trendsetter is similar to a toolsmith but has a motivation that is more motivated by recognition. They want to achieve technical excellence through innovation while also being better at their role. They are more likely to try something new even if it does not have a rational decision-making benefit for their organization.

- blog posts
- event talks

A trendsetter may also be somebody who craves social interaction. Their extraverted side may motivate them to exchange information and ideas with others. 

- meetups
- social media, chat and forums
- panels & webinars

They are more likely to take the word of others that a new tool, technique, or product is worth their attention.

## MODALITY

### Visual

This persona primarily learns from visual media. They want to see pictures, infographics, or video in order to learn about a new product or topic related to their work.

### Auditory

This persona primarily learns from listening. They will also watch video in order to learn about a new product, but primarily they want to hear somebody speak, ask questions, and engage socially to explore a new product or topic related to their work.

- podcast
- videos

### Experiential

This persona primarily learns through experiencing a product or service for themselves. Simply hearing and seeing is not enough, they want to be able to use a tool, product, or service on something related to their own projects or work to better explore how it behaves under various conditions.

An experiential learner is more likely to participate in a hackathon, take a workshop, or execute the steps in a tutorial.

They tend to be more skeptical and want to experience something for themselves rather than trust material from a product itself.
