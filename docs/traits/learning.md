# Career Stage

The stage of career is an indicator for how familiar a person may be with the skills and expectations of their role. 

This attribute is about the progression for a specific role, not a person. Somebody may have extensive professional experience, but if they've taken on a new role in a new industry for the purposes of defining the persona it has reset the clock.

## EARLY

Somebody who is early career could be an entry-level junior professional, a student, or a hobbyist. Whatever their job title may be, they are still seeking guidance from other professionals to validate their work. They are commonly building or looking to acquire foundational and core skills as an individual contributor (IC).

Often somebody early career is looking to demonstrate their prowess while building their portfolio of projects and experience.

This may be somebody with 5 years or fewer years of experience in their role and domain.

## MID-LEVEL

Somebody who recently transitioned from an IC role into a management or team leadership position. They may or may not be a player-coach who must balance hands-on work with managing others. They may have become more effient and reliable and are therefore a go-to person for implementation.

Somebody mid-career is more likely to be a lead in driving the decision-making direction, balancing innovation with organizational needs. This stage has moved beyond the basics and is taking ownership of critical components and developing further specialized domain expertise.

This is typically somebody with 5 to 10 years of experience in their role and domain.

## PROFICIENT

Somebody who has standardized their approach and has responsibility for mentoring early and mid-level team members. They will be called upon to drive inter-department and organizational strategy to foster business alignment. They will typically be consulted on architectural component level decision-making and the evaluation of performance. Likely have very limited technical hands-on work day-to-day and will delegate those tasks to others.

Proficiency will take the form of leading execution on projects and establishing best practices or policies for other career stages to follow.

Decision-making authority often rests with these experts, though often expected to be driven by analysis and information shared from others on the team.

This is commonly somebody with 10+ years of experience in their role and domain.



## PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

### Minimalist

A persona that is a minimalist will typically only do the bare minimum or mandatory learning to achieve an outcome. They are compliant and follow the direction of authority but may not seek to develop new skills in certain circumstances. Somebody who is a minimalist on one type of problem may be a trendsetter (below) in a different domain.

Typically, the minimalist has proficiency with their current skills and tools. They may have other priorities so their motivation is typically derived from driving revenue for the organization, meaning they want to keep their job or be seeking to take mandatory steps to acquire a better role.

It can be difficult to reach somebody with this style of professional development.

### Toolsmith

A toolsmith is motivated by the pursuit of learning and investing in themselves. They want to be ready with the appropriate tools for a future task so that they can complete it efficiently.

- conceptual guides
- event talks
- blog posts

### Trendsetter

A trendsetter is similar to a toolsmith but has a motivation that is more motivated by recognition. They want to achieve technical excellence through innovation while also being better at their role. They are more likely to try something new even if it does not have a rational decision-making benefit for their organization.

- hackathon
- blog posts
- event talks

A trendsetter may also be somebody who craves social interaction. Their extraverted side may motivate them to exchange information and ideas with others. 

- meetups
- social media, chat and forums
- panels & webinars

They are more likely to take the word of others that a new tool, technique, or product is worth their attention.

## MODALITY

### Visual

This persona primarily learns from visual media. They want to see pictures, infographics, or video in order to learn about a new product or topic related to their work.

### Auditory

This persona primarily learns from listening. They will also watch video in order to learn about a new product, but primarily they want to hear somebody speak, ask questions, and engage socially to explore a new product or topic related to their work.

- podcast
- videos

### Experiential

This persona primarily learns through experiencing a product or service for themselves. Simply hearing and seeing is not enough, they want to be able to use a tool, product, or service on something related to their own projects or work to better explore how it behaves under various conditions.

An experiential learner is more likely to participate in a hackathon, take a workshop, or execute the steps in a tutorial.

They tend to be more skeptical and want to experience something for themselves rather than trust material from a product itself.
