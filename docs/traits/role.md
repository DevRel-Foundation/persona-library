# Role

The role somebody has on a team is a significant trait when it comes to understanding the persona. In some organizations, a job title may take on multiple roles and the same role may appear in various types of organizations with different labels. Typically there may be a nuance to why a different label is needed.

## HIERARCHY

### Individual Contributor (IC)

An individual contributor produces value for the company through their work, but does not have any direct influence over the work of others.


### Lead 

May be a people leader or a function lead without direct authority. The implication is that this trait indicates that the persona through their role has direct structural influence over others in the organization when choosing what products, tools, and services they will use. 

## RESPONSIBILITIES

### Coding

A role with coding responsibility is what we most typically refer to as a "developer".

### Reviewing

A role with reviewing responsibility is expected to judge the quality of the work produced by others. Most often this responsibility is given to a lead, but can also be for peers.

### Planning

A person with responsibility for planning must understand the scope of a project, identify the tasks, and make sure the tasks are completed. 

### Reporting

A person with reporting responsibility must provide status and progress updates to other leaders on the state of a project which they are responsible.

### Marketing

A person with responsibility for product messaging and communications related to a product or service.
