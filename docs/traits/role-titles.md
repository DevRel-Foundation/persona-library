# Titles

This attribute helps identify the job titles one might typically find associated with a given persona.

The job title can indicate how long somebody has been in a role, how much they are compensated, or their level of expertise. Some companies may inflate titles or consolidate titles depending on the philosophy of leadership and human resource teams.

It is recommended to omit these from the titles defined in the persona and defer to the broader [experience](./role-experience.md) buckets instead.
- junior or jr.
- senior or sr.
- principal
- staff
- sr. staff
