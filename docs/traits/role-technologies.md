For a given role within an organization, there are often preferences and/or constraints. This type of data can be helpful to define for specific customizable personas to better understand for targeting. It may also lead to answering questions about your own product such as:

- Is somebody using a language or environment to be excluded (we don't have an SDK in COBOL)
- Is somebody using a language or environment the place to focus first (let's win web devs first)
- Is there a particular cloud environment that is a better fit for the industry (finance generally relies on microsoft ecosystem)
- Where in the SDLC or lifecycle does your product fit in best (during debugging so pdb compatibility)
