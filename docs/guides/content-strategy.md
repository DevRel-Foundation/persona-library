# PERSONAS FOR CONTENT STRATEGY

Developer Relations professionals frequently build content. To accomplish this goal, decisions must be made on:
- the format/type of content
- place to distribute the content
- matching audience expectations for tone of voice, messaging, etc.

Many organizations will target more than one persona through content, so personas become an effective reference point for contributors from across the organization to better define their target audience when planning individual tasks.

For example, you may break your personas up into existing customers and future customers. Some content can work for both audiences, but often you may build content to target each persona in a slightly different way. Additionally, you may be targeting both technical users and non-technical buyers, an insight that has implications in terms of messaging, level of detail, and placement of content.

## Benefits of Using Personas for Content

The identification of personas becomes a convenient short-hand notation when trying to achieve content goals.

### Help creators to focus their work.

The who, what, and where of a topic can be concisely expressed through the identification of a persona for each task.

### Transfers experience to new contributors.

A less experienced content creator may not fully understand the audience. Getting participation from multiple functions across the organization including DevRel, Product, Engineering, and Marketing can benefit from using personas to bridge the knowledge gap when participating in content activities and trying to understand the expectations of the audience.

### Facilitates working with third-party contributors.

Using the personas built within the [DevRel Foundation Persona System (DRF-PS)](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/persona-library) helps give a common form of communication when working with agencies, freelancers, and distributors. Typically, third-party contributors do not understand the organization's customers, program, or goals. Using the persona library however shares the fundamental essence of personas to speed up the process of discovery.

### Effective proven communication techniques.

New members of the DevRel profession may not know effective approaches to communicate with a persona. The training material and guides from the persona library help share better practices to improve the effectiveness of the work done.

The materials can help other functions of an organization or provide the training needed to hit the ground running.

### Efficient collaboration for a team.

Organizations can struggle with making decisions when there is not an alignment on who the audience is or may use terminology like "developer" but have very different ideas about what that means.

By using a persona, there is a more precise definition and implication to making sure everybody is on the same page. A content reviewer giving feedback will know with increased certainty how to help the content creator assess whether their work is effective because they will have a concise way of understanding the target audience and which feedback is relevant.

## Planning Content

### 1. Pick Your Personas

If you haven't already, use the [Persona Library Getting Started](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/persona-library) guide to explore and build the personas most important for your program.

### 2. Setup Your Content Tracking Tool

Creating a workflow for tracking your content program is beyond the scope of this document to describe. It is common however to use a tool like a spreadsheet, template or database that defines tasks for each piece of content. You can review the [DevRel Foundation Tools Catalog](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/tools-catalog) for examples such as AirTable, SmartSheet, Notion, Google Sheets, Excel, Google Docs and more.

The tracking tool should include an attribute for `personas`. This should be a constrained list to include the 5-7 target personas relevant for your content strategy to focus. 

For example, you might identify the following personas to be most important for your content plans:

- security-biz-lead-pro-b2b-startup-I
- security-biz-I-pro-b2b-enterprise-toolsmith-I
- security-dev-ic-mid-b2b-I
- security-dev-I-pro-b2b-trendsetter-I
- security-I

Each content task would map to one or more of those personas.

### 3. Content Production

When it is time to produce content, the persona provides definition to the traits of your target audience. When speaking or writing content, you'll use the frame of reference of each persona to gauge whether or not your content is appropriate.

#### Professional Development

Review the **[learning style](../traits/learning-style.md)** of your audience as it applies to their professional development is an important factor.

A _trendsetter_ would be more likely to look for content that helps them to learn new trends and topics for use on future projects. You might create content that really is topical and cutting edge for early adoption.

A _minimalist_ on the other hand is looking for content that gets straight to the point and explains only what is necessary to solve a problem or accomplish a task. They aren't looking at your content to learn, they want an answer and then will move on.

A _toolsmith_ wants to be an expert. They may dismiss new fads, but the maturing tools and techniques that have lasting value is where they want to invest their time. The conceptual explanations may be more valued along with tradeoffs as for why a product, service, or tool is beneficial over alternatives helps build their understanding.

How a consumer of your content approaches problems is a decision point for how you craft the messages and structure.

#### Career Stage

The **[experience](../traits/career.md)** your audience has influences how much context or explanation is necessary. 

Somebody who is _proficient_ has a mastery of their domain and the history of it, so introductory details and fundamentals may not resonate in terms of the content they choose to consume. You should target more niche and advanced content in order to reach this audience.

Conversely, somebody who is _early_ in their career may not be familiar with all the history and past decisions that are prevalent in their industry and role. They may want a bit of background on past learnings and mistakes that led to the current state when building content.

#### Learning Modality

The **[modality](../traits/learning.md)** a persona prefers is another important attribute to consider. If you are only creating video content, the persona of somebody who prefers written content in documentation will not be likely to engage with your content. 

In most cases, you'll want to create a balanced mix to really emphasize which type of learner will consume your content. An _early_ career consumer may be more likely to seek visual content like videos and infographics, whereas somebody who is _proficient_ may be more likely to consume something experiential like a tutorial with exploration steps.

You might have different personas for each learning modality but mostly commonly they'll be derived. That might mean your organization overall has a set of personas but for content purposes you might segment it to highlight this distinction:

- security-I-visual-I
- security-I-experiential-I

#### Role

The **[role](../traits/role.md)** of a person gets us closer to understanding their specific content needs.

The core of the role bifurcates the world into _development_ and _business_ concerns. Additionally, the hierachical role within an organization includes _ICs_ who tend to be more practiioners that require deeply technical solutions and _Leads_ who consume more typically known as thought leadership and organization principles from their content. The _responsibilities_ of the role can be used to further sub-divide content creation but the core role often maps cleanly to planning, coding, reporting, etc. day-to-day responsibilities.

#### Funnel Stage

The **[relationship](../traits/organization.md)** of a persona comes into play when building content because we may have a shared channel that distributes content to multiple types of relationship. An existing _customer_ for example doesn't need to know what your organization does in a blog post or newsletter because they have already been engaged. That same blog post or newsletter however may go to a _lurker_ who is curious but does not yet understand all elements of your business or brand. A _lead_ may further need not just an explanation, but insights that help close a deal where content should be more persuasive in achieving a last touch call to action.

Providing links to content that helps each type of relationship type find more targeted content is a good practice to follow.

### 4. Content Delivery

Once you've developed content, you need to get it in front of your persona. To reach your intended audience, you should take some traits into consideration.

#### Learning Style

You'll want to create a variety of content that maps to the **[learning style](../traits/learning.md)** of your most important personas. You may focus on one style at first, but achieving a balance will help you reach the most consumers possible.

#### Industry

The **[company industry](../traits/organization.md)** is a foundational element for distribution. When customizing your personas, the resources can be expanded upon so that you reach your target audience more effectively on both owned and third-party channels.

* use `format` to filter channels that map to learning modality
* use `level` to filter channels by career stage, an early career professional might be more common to consume 100 level channels
