# PERSONAS FOR CONTENT STRATEGY

Developer Relations professionals will frequently need to build content. Defining which content to build, when to build it, and where to deliver it are foundational decisions that must be made as part of a content strategy.

The use of personas in content strategy is important because it helps an author focus on their audience and their expectations. This is particularly important with less experienced content professionals who may participate in a content program. The consequence is developing content that is not delivered in the style that maps to your ideal customer profile and is ineffective.

Why use the [Persona Library](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/persona-library) for content strategy:
- a common understanding of the audience you are trying to reach across your team
- a effective approach of how to communicate with that persona
- a transferrable communication language when working with third-party agencies and companies who are familiar with this persona library to quickly ramp up on your target profile
- a shared set of resources to help onboard new members of your team in understanding your personas

## Planning Content

### 1. Pick Your Personas

Use the **DevRel Foundation Persona System** guide to identify the most important personas for your program.

### 2. Setup Your Content Tracking Tool

Creating a workflow for tracking your content program is beyond the scope of this document to describe. It is common however to use a tool like a spreadsheet or database that defines each piece of content and certain attributes about it. You can check-out the [DevRel Foundation Tools Catalog](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/tools-catalog) for examples such as AirTable, SmartSheet, Notion, Google Sheets, Excel, and more.

You will want to add a field or column called `personas` that can be constrained to just the personas you will be focusing on. By using the standard traits defined by this DevRel Foundation Persona Library you can help set expectations for members on your team while providing shared resources to help with understanding.

### 3. Content Production

The most important persona traits to understand when producing content include:

**[professional development](../traits/learning-style.md)**

A trendsetter will be looking for new trends and topics to learn more about what it is and how they might use it on future projects. A minimalist however would look for content that is straight to the point, explains only what is needed to accomplish a task. A toolsmith would like a much broader explanation for what the various tools are and their tradeoffs for when to use one over another in speicfic circumstances.

**[career stage](../traits/career.md)**

The career stage tells more about the level of description needed for basic content over advanced content. Somebody who is proficient on a subject area and is a toolsmith won't have patience for basic explanations. An early career trendsetter may need additional context of what trends over time led to a particular relevance for the topic needed now.

**[modality](../traits/learning.md)**

The modality tells you what format to make content in to reach your intended audience -- videos, documentation, presentations, etc. will only work in the right context for how somebody wants to learn and how they want to learn it.

**[role](../traits/role.md)**

The role of the persona and specifically their responsibilities is a good indication of what tone of voice and what to say or not say to that audience.

**[relationship](../traits/organization.md)**

When building content, the nature of the relationship for the persona becomes fundamental in terms of the context needed to describe your business, product, or service. If the relationship is a customer such as a newsletter sent to existing customers, you would have different communication expectations than you would when building content for the documentation or a third-party content marketing channel where you may engage with prospects who do not know anything about your brand.

### 4. Content Delivery

Once you've developed content, you need to get it in front of your persona. To reach your intended audience, you should take some traits into consideration.

**[learning style](../traits/learning.md)**

Not all personas will have the same learning style, so you may need to create variations of content and deliver it differently for each modality.

**[company industry](../traits/organization.md)**

The industry and its intersection with the [professional development](../traits/learning.md) trait will be a good indicator of which sources of information a persona might consult. The [career stage](../traits/career.md) also comes into play here as somebody who is early career may consult specific types of introductory learning-based resources whereas somebody more proficient will be targeting more advanced sources.
