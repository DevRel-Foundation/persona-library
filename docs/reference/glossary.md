# GLOSSARY
Terminology that is used when working with Personas.

## buyer persona

A persona that focuses on the commercial decision-making traits that can aid marketing and sales activities by emphasizing purchasing decisions and buying behaviors. The focus on this type of persona is more on market research and synthesizing knowledge about existing customer or developers.

## customer persona

A representation of an existing customer who has already purchased your product or service, highlighting their ongoing needs, satisfaction factors, and loyalty drivers. This may be a specific instance of a persona to acknowledge an exsiting relationship.

## ideal customer profile

A detailed description of a company or organization that would derive the most value from your product or service, become a long-term customer, and potentially advocate for your brand. Unlike personas which focus on individuals, ICPs typically describe the organizational characteristics such as industry, company size, revenue, geography, and business challenges.

## jobs to be done

A framework that focuses on understanding the specific task a developer is trying to accomplish (the 'job') rather than customer attributes. This approach often used by product and user experience teams helps to identify the real reasons people use products or services rather than behavioral personas in general.

## maturity model

An approach to describing the evolution of capabilities, processes, and organizational behaviors to evaluate the development or sophistication of a role or organization. There may be a scoring system that can be used to assess where on the maturity progression one sits to judge the appropriateness of a solution or product fit.

## persona

A research-based, fictional representation of your target audience or users that embodies their characteristics, behaviors, goals, and pain points.

## Persona Library System

A structured framework and approach to gathering personas that can help an organization or community to make decisions.

## PLS

Acronym for the DEVREL Persona Library System

*See also: [Persona Library System](#persona-library-system)*

## quantitative persona

A persona created primarily from numerical data, statistics, and analytics rather than qualitative interviews or observations, often using segmentation from large data sets.

## segmentation

The division of a market or audience into discrete groups that share some common characteristics, behaviors, or needs, which can then be used as a basis for persona development. Can work well with quantitative means of sizing each segment for prioritization.

## trait

A distinguishing quality or characteristic that defines an aspect of a persona, such as technical skill level, job role, or communication preferences.

## user persona

A persona that focuses on usability and user-centered design traits that can aid product and user-experience decisions. The focus is put on usage patterns, technical requirements, and experience goals.

## user story

A concise description of a feature told from the perspective of a persona, typically following the format: 'As a [persona], I want [goal or job to be done] so that [reason].'
