## Types of Contributions

Contribution can take a few forms.

1. Provide positive reinforcement. Let us know that you found the resources here helpful and we'll give you a shoutout in our testimonials.
2. Provide constructive feedback. Let us know how you think things we can improve and we'll review your suggestions.
3. Make a suggestion for a reference item to be added to the list of resources.
4. Share your persona definitions to include as an example in the general collection or as a persona set.
5. Join discussions during working group calls.
6. Make suggestions to improve the schemas standard for the Persona Library System.
7. Contribute source code to improve the tooling and visualizations of the Persona Library.

## How-to Make a Contribution

Choose the approach that is easiest for you. 

1. Send an email to wg-resource-aggregation + owner AT lists.dev-rel.org to reach the managers who can take action on your suggestions.
2. Start a **New Discussion** in the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/wg-resource-aggregation/discussions). There is a category for feedback and one for the Persona Library more specifically. This is a great place to ask a question if unsure.
3. Create an **Issue** in the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/wg-resource-aggregation/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Aresource%3Apersonas) for the project with the `resource:personas` label.
4. Assign an **Issue** to yourself or put in a PR using typical GitHub workflows for change requests.

## What Should You Contribute

Review the [Open GitHub Issues](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/wg-resource-aggregation/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Aresource%3Apersonas) with the label `resource:personas` for some ideas. If there are tags with `good-first-issue` this helps identify smaller projects that have fewer dependencies so somebody new to the working group can pitch in.

## How-to Get Help Contributing
