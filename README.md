In addition to the DRF Persona System, there are reference materials to learn more about the process of creating and managing personas.

- [articles](./data/reference/articles.json)
- [books](./data/reference/books.json)
- [tools](./data/reference/tools.json)
- [video](./data/reference/videos.json)

You can run `./bin/json-to-md --build output --data ./data/reference/*.json` to create markdown files for a more user friendly way to review the references.
