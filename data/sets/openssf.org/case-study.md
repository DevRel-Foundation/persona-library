## Goals for Persona Development

A few objectives emerged from the work being undertaken.

### 1. Create a user journey map to help with onboarding

> This is work designed to help the OpenSSF produce a "landscape" or "trail map" that allows newcomers to easily understand and then engage with our community & materials.

### 2. Create outreach plans for specific projects

> Develop an outreach strategy to initiate adoption and build awareness of the toolbelt solution. The outreach should be persona / platform based.

### 3. Create marketing plans for general awareness of the foundation overall

> Attract new members and onboard existing members.
